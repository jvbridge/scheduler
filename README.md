# Day Scheduler

A simple daily scheduiling app

## Description

This is a simple scheduling app that uses exernal libraries to format itself and
local storage to hold events that are saved. 

## Installation

You can see the app by going to https://jvbridge.github.io/scheduler/

## Usage

The app uses a 24 hour clock to make a row for each hour. Hours in the past are 
gray. Hours in the future are green. The current hour is blue. 

Clicking on the text in the middle allows you to type your own event. 

Clicking the save icon allows you to save the current event to local storage, 
so that it may persist on a refresh.
